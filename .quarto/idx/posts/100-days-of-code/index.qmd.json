Also, I was picking suitable language to start my career.\n\nAt first, I started learning JavaScript with the help of FreeCodeCamp. It did went well, however I switched to Python.\n\n> Coding is a habit. Switching programming language brings demotivation. It's because you need to start learning all over again.\n\nOnce, I was reading Quincy Larson's blog (teacher at FreeCodeCamp).\n\nEventually, I found something worth reading -- One does not simply learn to code.\n\nAs you can see the picture below How to : Draw a Horse. Simply, you can't improve your coding skills with just tutorial courses.\n\n![](Coding-is-not-simple.jpg)\n\nLater, I realized learning to code is not just enough. However, building with the practical projects is mandatory. So, to get some suggestions, I went through Quora / reddits.\n\nFinally, I stumbled upon an interesting article, [Join the #100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4%22), where you\n\n-   Code at least an hour a day for next 100 days.\n-   Tweet everyday about your progress\n-   Make this a public commitment.\n-   If you're interested, you can join me at 100 Days of Code.\n\n\n![](starting-day-1.jpg)\n\nStarting from March 7, 2018, I officially announce that I've accepted challenge 100 Days of Code.\n\nIn days ahead, I will be learning and start doing the Data Science (Analytics) and Machine Learning projects.\n\nFinally, for those who want to take part in #100DaysOfCode challenge, you're free to share this with your friend. Have fun, Enjoy Coding !!!.\n\nUpdate : I've completed the challenge, read my [#100DaysOfCode story](//bjungbogati.com.np/posts/towards-data-science).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":false,"freeze":true,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.615","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmos","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Starting with #100DaysOfCode","description":"Here's the story of my coding journey that I stepped in and how I allowed myself to make coding as a habit.\n","author":[{"name":"Binod Jung Bogati"}],"date":"03-07-2018","image":"starting-day-1.jpg","categories":["Personal","100 Days of Code"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
