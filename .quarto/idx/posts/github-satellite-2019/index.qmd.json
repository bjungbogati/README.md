I had travelled from Nepal and there were other Campus Experts from 10 different nations with GitHub Developer Program Manager.\n\n\n![](campus-experts-github.jpg)\nThe Campus Experts help build community at their campus. It is difficult to meet each other in-person and the events like the conference are the one which helps Campus Experts get together, talk and share their experiences.\n\nIt all started a day before GitHub Satellite, we had Campus Experts Meetup. All campus experts attending delivered lightning talks shared their experiences, had good foods and drink.\n\n![](building-active-community.jpg)\n\nGood sketch notes by Carlos Gilmar (@carlos) to summarise Campus Experts meetup.\n\n![](campus-expert-meet.jpg)\n\nThe next day, around 8:30 AM, I went to the Kraftwerk, GitHub Satellite venue. I grabbed the batches, had some breakfast and went to reserve the seats for the keynote.\n\nAt 9:30 AM, Nat Friedman, GitHub CEO started his keynote.\n\n![](keynote-nat-friedman.jpg)\nNat told the 36 million developer calls “GitHub Home”. He featured the first black hole image, introduced Dr. Katie Bouman all the way from Boston. To our surprise, the core team behind black hole image, Andrew, Kazu, Sarah, C.K, Roman and Lindy joined the keynote on the stage.\n\n![](katie-bauman-with-her-team.jpeg)\n\n\nThere was an announcement about collaboration with White Source and Depandabot.\n\n![](dependabot.jpg)\n\nThen, Devon Zuegel announced support for open source contributor called, GitHub Sponsors. To sum up the keynote, Nat announced GitHub matching fund i.e 200% fund transfer on sponsorship.\n\n\n![](github-sponsors.jpg)\n\nAt the session, In the Shadows of Black Hole, I got to know more about Black Hole.\n\n![](reality-behind-black-hole-image.jpg)\nDuring the conference break, I got to meet with Nat Friedman, CEO of GitHub, Lieke Boon, Developer Program Manager at GitHub.\n\n![](with-nat-friedman.jpg)\n\n![](with-lieke-boon.jpg)\n\nIt was great experience so far. I'm very thankful to GitHub for providing such an opportunity to attend this conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":false,"freeze":true,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.615","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmos","title-block-banner":true,"title":"That Day at GitHub Satellite 2019","description":"I attended GitHub Satellite 2019 conference held at Kraftwerk, Berlin on May 23.
