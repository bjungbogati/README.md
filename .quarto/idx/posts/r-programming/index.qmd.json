It is supported by R Foundation for Statistical Computing. Today, the R language is popular among statisticians, data science as a statistical, data analysis and data science tool.\n\n![](R-programming.png)\n\n## Why R Programming?\n\nR has a great eco-system for data manipulation, calculation, and graphical visualizations. It includes:\n\n-   an effective data handling and storage facility,\n-   a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular, matrices,\n-   a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,\n-   graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and\n-   a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive\n-   functions and input and output facilities.\n\n## Who uses R?\n\nThe companies like social media to search engine giants uses R.\n\n-   Facebook - For behavior analysis related to status updates and profile pictures.\n-   Google - For advertising effectiveness and economic forecasting.\n-   Twitter - For data visualization and semantic clustering\n-   Microsoft - Acquired Revolution R company and use it for a variety of purposes.\n-   IBM - Uses for internal business and analytical tools\n\n![](giants-using-R.png)\n\n### The popularity of R by Industry\n\nR has been widely used in industry. It's become more popular every year.\n\n![](R-by-industry-visit.png)\n\n**R has CRAN**\n\nIt's one stopper package management system called CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network). It provides eco-system for R packages to make your work easier.\n\n![](R-package-network.png)\n\nBeside this, R has lots of things you need to work with data. The R ecosystem is changing with expansion of data science field. In general, R language has contributed to its value as a programming language and as a data analysis environment.\n\nIf you want to work with data science, R can be your best tool to get started.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":false,"freeze":true,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.603","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmos","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Brief about R programming","description":"This article is about R programming, it's importance, who uses it and why it's popular among statisticians.\n","author":[{"name":"Binod Jung Bogati"}],"date":"12-18-2019","image":"R-programming.png","categories":["Rstats"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
