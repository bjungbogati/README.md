Also, I was picking suitable language to start my career.\n\nAt first, I started learning JavaScript with the help of FreeCodeCamp. It did went well, however I switched to Python.\n\n> Coding is a habit. Switching programming language brings demotivation. It's because you need to start learning all over again.\n\nOnce, I was reading Quincy Larson's blog (teacher at FreeCodeCamp).\n\nEventually, I found something worth reading -- One does not simply learn to code.\n\nAs you can see the picture below How to : Draw a Horse. Simply, you can't improve your coding skills with just tutorial courses.\n\n![](Coding-is-not-simple.jpg)\n\nLater, I realized learning to code is not just enough. However, building with the practical projects is mandatory. So, to get some suggestions, I went through Quora / reddits.\n\nFinally, I stumbled upon an interesting article, [Join the #100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4%22), where you\n\n-   Code at least an hour a day for next 100 days.\n-   Tweet everyday about your progress\n-   Make this a public commitment.\n-   If you're interested, you can join me at 100 Days of Code.\n\n### Starting 100 Days of Code -- Day 1\n\n![](starting-day-1.jpg)\n\nStarting from March 7, 2018, I officially announce that I've accepted challenge 100 Days of Code.\n\nIn days ahead, I will be learning and start doing the Data Science (Analytics) and Machine Learning projects.\n\nFinally, for those who want to take part in #100DaysOfCode challenge, you're free to share this with your friend. Have fun, Enjoy Coding !!!.\n\nUpdate : I've completed the challenge, read my [#100DaysOfCode story](//bjungbogati.com.np/posts/towards-data-science).\n",
