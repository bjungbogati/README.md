-   a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
-   graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and
-   a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive
-   functions and input and output facilities.
