> [Solve-a-thon](https://dataliteracy.github.io/solveathon/) 2019 was a two-day, the first of its kind, was organized by the World Bank and The Asia Foundation with support from UKAID at the Kathmandu University School of Management on 14-15 December.

The agenda behind the Nepal Solvathon 2019 were:

-   Find data-driven solutions to issues facing our society today.

-   Collaborate, contribute, and share data skills with the community while working on data projects.

-   Contribute to an emerging open data community in Nepal.

We had 3 people on the DataSansar team i.e Diwash Shrestha, Prakriti Dhungana and Binod Jung Bogati (me).

**Day 1: Starts with Problem Statement**

There was some pre-defined problem in Solvathon. Our team had decided to work in the tourism sector since we applied.

Also, [Visit Nepal 2020](https://visitnepal2020.com/) was approaching, so our team planned to work on the Nepal Tourism Dashboard project. Our project was developed for helping Nepal Government for decision-making looking at the statistical data published by the Nepal Tourism Board.

**Day 2: Building a Dashboard with R**

On day two, we build the prototype using R + Flexdashboard. We integrated different visualization tools like plotly, highcharter.
