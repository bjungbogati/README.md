It was a great experience attending the GitHub Satellite as a Campus Expert. I had travelled from Nepal and there were other Campus Experts from 10 different nations with GitHub Developer Program Manager.

The Campus Experts help build community at their campus. It is difficult to meet each other in-person and the events like the conference are the one which helps Campus Experts get together, talk and share their experiences.

It all started a day before GitHub Satellite, we had Campus Experts Meetup. All campus experts attending delivered lightning talks shared their experiences, had good foods and drink.

Good sketch notes by Carlos Gilmar (@carlos) to summarise Campus Experts meetup.

The next day, around 8:30 AM, I went to the Kraftwerk, GitHub Satellite venue. I grabbed the batches, had some breakfast and went to reserve the seats for the keynote.

At 9:30 AM, Nat Friedman, GitHub CEO started his keynote.

Nat told the 36 million developer calls “GitHub Home”. He featured the first black hole image, introduced Dr. Katie Bouman all the way from Boston. To our surprise, the core team behind black hole image, Andrew, Kazu, Sarah, C.K, Roman and Lindy joined the keynote on the stage.

It was great experience so far. I'm very thankful to GitHub for providing such an opportunity to attend this conference.
