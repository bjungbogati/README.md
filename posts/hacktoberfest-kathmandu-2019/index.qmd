> Hacktoberfest is a worldwide celebration of open source software and is open for everyone! It is all about encouraging meaningful contributions to the open source ecosystem, for beginners and veterans alike.

In 2018, I started with a pull-request (hunting) in documentation part. I was glad that some of them got merged as well.

Finally, I also got some swags from Hacktoberfest.

### Motivation

Participating in Hacktoberfest motivated me to host a meetup in Kathmandu.

So, we made a project made a project hacktm.js.org, where participants can learn sending the pull requests.
