Running code in R is easy (if copy/paste). Our motive here is not to teach you R. However, you'll catch with basic R code in no-time.

-   First, make sure you've installed R .
-   Then, search and open **R**.
-   Copy the code below and run it in your R console

Run the code below:

```{r}
# printing 
print("Hello World")

#assignment 
 a <- 10 
 b <- 15

#add 
 a + b

#add + assign 
  c <- a + b

# print 1 to 100 
  1:10

# sum from 1 to 100 
sum(1:100)

# mean / average 
mean(c(10, 15, 20, 25))

# median / central value 
median(c(5, 10, 15, 25, 30))

# square root 
sqrt(64)

# function 
addition <- function(x, y){ x + y }

# calling function 
addition(10, 15)
```
