### Ever Explored the Famous Failures that Became Success ?

> **ALBERT EINSTEIN** didn't speak until age four and didn't read until age seven. His teachers labeled him "slow" and "mentally handicapped." But Einstein just had a different way of thinking. He later won the Nobel prize in physics.
>
> **WALT DISNEY** was fired by a newspaper editor because he "lacked imagination and had no good ideas." Several more of his businesses failed before the premiere of his movie Snow White. Today, most childhoods wouldn't be the same without his ideas.
>
> **WINSTON CHURCHILL** failed the sixth grade. He was defeated in every public office role he ran for. Then he became the British prime minister at the age of 62.

If a drop of water falls in a lake, there is no identity. But if it falls on a leaf, it shines. We need to choose the best place where we can shine.

-   To know how to do something well is to enjoy it

### What Does a Person Really Need to Succeed ?

I think everyone can answer to this, but few provides the worthy answers. Everybody talks about passion etc but, we have never thinked what we are passionate about, where it really comes from or how it grows stronger ? Before that let's see the John Von Achan's awesome video .

These four things will always you to success.

1.  Dedication
2.  Planning
3.  Passion
4.  Hardwork

Enjoy your work at the end of day and utilize resources for maximum result.

Problems that MSPs are facing in their respetive colleges - Approval to conduct Tech Events within College - No or Inactive IT Community - No academic calendar listing Tech events - Lack of support/motivation from College Administration

Possible Solutions : - Request your college management (Highlight the both students and college benefits) - Build strong network within college (Form IT Club, IT community of college in facebook) - Cooperate with the IT Community - Tie-up with the Class representative of your college - Maintain good relation with College administration
