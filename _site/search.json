    "text": "Introduction to Data Science\nYou might have heard about data science, don‚Äôt you? (of course)\nBefore introduction about data science, we will go through basic hierarchical model of data.\n\nHere, we have DIKI pyramid showing relationships between data, information, knowledge, and insights.\n\nDATA is an unorganized and raw information. It carries the unprocessed information. ‚Äî FACTS and FIGURES\nINFORMATION is a processed data which has purpose and value. ‚Äî WHO WHAT WHERE and WHEN\nKNOWLEDGE is an understanding of data via exploring it. ‚Äî HOW and WHY\nINSIGHT is an empathy or finding a bigger picture of a scenario. ‚Äî MEANING\n\nLet‚Äôs suppose you own a restaurant. Now, your target is to maximize the profit. So, you started doing some cool things.\n\nFirst, you record the food items you sold. It‚Äôs your data.\nWith your data, you‚Äôll find numbers of food items sold. It‚Äôs an information.\nDoing further analysis, you‚Äôll understand why certain foods are popular. That‚Äôs knowledge.\nTo increase profit, you‚Äôll deduce least sold food items with the popular one. This‚Äôs insight.\n\nSo, we can say that data science is a way of uncovering an insight from the data. When data couples with technology it can solve the complex problems and help in decision making.\nDefining the Data Science\nData Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines computer science, mathematics, and domain expertise. It has wide applications in business, health, government, social sciences and many other areas.\n\n\nFoundation of Data Science\nSo, to turn your data into meaningful insights, you need a data science team. The team who excels in the three foundation skills:\n\nDomain Expertise ‚Äì to define the problem of a particular field.\nMathematics ‚Äì to help the understand complexity and increase the problem-solving capability.\nComputer Science ‚Äì to create an environment that efficiently handles data.\n\nAbove all, the data science exists at the intersection of these three foundation skills.\n\n1. Domain Expertise\nThe science behind data is about discovery and building knowledge out of it. First, you need to ask the right questions about the problem. Then, generate hypotheses that apply to data. Eventually, you can test the hypothesis with statistical methods.\nEveryone wants to know, what‚Äôs going to happen with their sales. Indeed, it‚Äôs an obvious question. But, domain experts can ask more specific questions, such as the following:\n\nWhat will be our sales next week?\nCan we increase productivity in the marketing department using our sales data?\nDoes this product attribute from sales data, contribute to our product sales?\n\nCertainly, questions first then data.\n\n\n2. Mathematics\nIn the real world, data science is about applying mathematics. Once you get and clean your data, the next process you do is pull the insight out of it. You need to apply specific math and statistical methods to address complex problems. So, mathematics is important for your data science team.\nAmazingly, Data + Math = Machine Learning\nNot to mention, the best teams often develop machine learning (AI) tools for predictive models. But, you don‚Äôt always need them to solve every problem.\n\n\n3. Computer Science\nOf course, data science happens within computer systems. The data science team members work with various computing tools (programming). Besides that, your team needs to have specific technical knowledge (data structures and algorithms).\nYour team member might work with Big data, AI (Artificial Intelligence), and Databases. It requires different skill sets and processing tools. Having the right data science work environment is important as having a physical work environment.\nEventually, we can say that, data science is a team sport. As a result, your data science team needs to incorporate with skillful players. Together your team solves specific challenges and problems. This creates new opportunities and possibilities for a better world."

From the social channels to the blogs, images, sounds, and videos.\nEvery minute, the world generates yotta bytes of data.\n\n\nIn a case study, IBM estimates 90% of the world‚Äôs data generated in the past few years. This means every day, the world creates 2.5 quintillion bytes of data.\n\nThe amounts of data are so huge that, organizations are struggling to handle it. They need technical experts to extract the powerful insights and make smarter business decisions.\nTo address this challenge, Data Science has emerged as hottest professions. Since 2012, the data science exploded in the data analytics industry.\n\nAccording to LinkedIn‚Äôs 2017 Emerging Jobs Report, data scientist job demand has grown over 650% since 2012. It‚Äôs the same year that Harvard Business Review reported it ‚ÄúSexiest job of the 21st century.‚Äù\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, the demand for data scientists is increasing over a short period.\n\nMcKinsey reported that by 2018, we will see 50% gap in the data scientists supply versus demand. And, the United States alone will experience a shortage of 190,000 skilled data scientists.\n\nHence, the data science job will continue to grow over the next decade. We think this is the right time to advance your career as data professionals."

And this mechanism is not other than data science.\n\nWith advanced technology, data science is becoming more powerful. The application of data science has a wide coverage. Some of the data science applications, we use are given below.\n1. Search Engines\nThe most popular data science application is search engines. Daily we use search giants like Google, Yahoo, Bing, Duckduckgo, Ask, etc to search our queries. These searches are optimized with data science algorithms to deliver the best results.\nEvery day, Google process 20 petabytes of data. Without data science, we can‚Äôt even imagine the Google we see today.\n2. Recommender Systems\nFrom online shopping to movie watchlist, everywhere we get recommendations. Popular services like Youtube, Netflix, Amazon, Twitter, and Google are popular among us. These services all recommend their product based on search relevance and user preference. The services use search history to recommend a product.\nHence, the recommendation system makes our life easy.\n3. Fraud Detection and Financial Analysis\nThe banks and insurance companies are implementing data science. They use it to forecast claim rates, default rates, and repayment rates.\nSimilarly, the authorities monitor the financial market and identify illegal trading activities.\n4. Delivery logistics\nDelivery service has never been so easy. From GrubHub (food) to DHL/FedEx (logistics), everyone is competitive. Their system uses data science to optimize delivery routes, operational costs, and time.\nSo, the customers benefit from the fastest delivery with minimal charges.\n5. Healthcare\nData science transforming health care. With the historical medical data, one can predict more accurately which treatments are effective and which are not.\n6. Disaster risk alert\nData Science can help us approach to identify, assess, and alert the risks of disaster. We can build models for risk from weather and disaster data (flood, wind damage). These models help us alert and prevent disaster damage from happening.\nBesides that, there are lots of fields like education, natural science, economics that makes use of data science."

    "text": "Data Science Roles in the Industry\nIn data science, there are three main career paths: data analyst, data scientist, and data engineer.\n\n\n1. Data Analyst\nData analyst plays the role of a junior data scientist. It is an entry level job if you‚Äôre planning to start a career in data science.\nData analyst don‚Äôt invent new wheels, rather they use existing tools to solve the problems\nData Analyst skills:\n\nProgramming (R, Python, SAS)\nStatistics\nDatabase (SQL)\nData Wrangling (Pandas, Excel, dplyr)\nData Visualization (PowerBI, Tableau, matplotlib, ggplot2)\n\nBesides technical skills, data analyst also need reasoning and communication skills to be successful.\nWhat does data analyst do?\nData analyst works under the guidance of data professionals. They do collect, process, summarise, and report the insights of data.\nThey make data visualization to make reports and communicate results.\n\n\n2. Data Scientist\nThe data scientist is a senior role of a data analyst. Both data analyst and data scientist share a common goal to extract insights out of data.\nBut, the data scientist work on more complex problems. They work with huge data and requires advanced skills as opposed to the data analyst.\nData Scientist skills :\n\nProgramming (R, Python, SAS)\nMathematics and Statistics\nMachine Learning\nBig data (Apache Spark, Hive, Hadoop)\nDatabase (SQL, NoSQL)\nData visualization (PowerBI, Tableau, Plotly, Matplotlib, ggplot2)\n\nWhat does data scientist do?\nData scientist use data to solve business problems. A data analyst summarises the past, however a data scientist plans for the future. They use data to make strategies to solve various problems.\nThey create machine learning models to understand data, recognize patterns, and automate the iterative process.\n\n\n3. Data Engineer\nData Engineers builds the data infrastructure for the data-driven organization. They provide a platform to retrieve the data for experiments.\nData Engineer skills:\n\nBig data technologies (Hadoop, Spark)\nSQL technologies (MySQL, SQL Server)\nNoSQL technologies (MongoDB)\nData warehousing solutions\nCloud (Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, AWS)\n\nWhat does data engineer do?\nData engineers provide an easy process to extract, transform and load data. They also help data scientist to make scalable data science products.\nThey help data scientist to work with big data.\nData science is a hot and emerging field of technology.

    "text": "We have seen lots of visuals in our life like pictures, animations, and some graphical plots. Graphics help or make easy to get an idea or understand anything. Visualization is an important part of the Data science or Data Analysis. In this blog, we will learn about visualization in¬† R by creating different type of plots.\n\nLets Start Visualization\n\nWe will use ggplot2 package which follows the grammar¬†of graphics. Its¬†very powerful tool for visualization and very famous in R community.\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n#mpg dataset is found in R preloaded\nstr(mpg)\nClasses 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':  234 obs. of  11 variables:\n $ manufacturer: chr  \"audi\" \"audi\" \"audi\" \"audi\" ...\n $ model       : chr  \"a4\" \"a4\" \"a4\" \"a4\" ...\n $ displ       : num  1.8 1.8 2 2 2.8 2.8 3.1 1.8 1.8 2 ...\n $ year        : int  1999 1999 2008 2008 1999 1999 2008 1999 1999 2008 ...\n $ cyl         : int  4 4 4 4 6 6 6 4 4 4 ...\n $ trans       : chr  \"auto(l5)\" \"manual(m5)\" \"manual(m6)\" \"auto(av)\" ...\n $ drv         : chr  \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" \"f\" ...\n $ cty         : int  18 21 20 21 16 18 18 18 16 20 ...\n $ hwy         : int  29 29 31 30 26 26 27 26 25 28 ...\n $ fl          : chr  \"p\" \"p\" \"p\" \"p\" ...\n $ class       : chr  \"compact\" \"compact\" \"compact\" \"compact\" ...\nFrom above code, we found out that mpg has 234 rows and 11 columns. We will create different type of visualization using ggplot2 package.\n\nScatterplot\n\nggplot(mpg)+ geom_point(aes(cty,displ,colour= cyl))\n\n¬†\nA scatterplot uses the value of two variables to plot on the graph.¬†A scatterplot shows the¬† correlation between two variables in the graph. In this scatterplot, we used color to define the distribution of data using the third variable.\n\nBar Chart\n\nggplot(mpg,aes(hwy,displ))+geom_col(aes(fill=cyl))\n\nBarchart uses 2 variable to show its plot using rectangular shape. Barchart height shows the sum of y axis data on basis of the x-axis variable.\n\nCount chart\n\nggplot(mpg)+geom_bar(aes(manufacturer,fill=manufacturer))+  coord_flip()\n¬†\nThe Count chart uses only one variable and plots the presence count of variable.\n\nBubble Chart\n\nggplot(mpg)+ geom_point(aes(cty,displ,size=hwy,colour=\"red\",alpha=0.5),show.legend = F)\n\nThe Bubble chart is same as a scatterplot only difference is it uses an extra third variable to show the size of the points.\n\nLine Chart\n\nggplot(mpg,aes(displ,cty))+geom_point()+geom_line()\n\nThe line chart is plot which shows information by connecting series of points with straight lines.In above picture, we can see the line plot.B ut this dataset is not good to plot a time series so we will create a data frame with a random variable and plot another line plot.\nx = sample(1:100, 20, replace=FALSE)\ny = sample(1:100, 20, replace=FALSE)\n\n#combine x and y create a dataframe\ndata <- data.frame(x,y)\nggplot(data,aes(x,y))+geom_point()+geom_line()\n¬†\n\nIn this line chart, we can see the series of the data points connected by the lines.¬† Time series and finacial analysis use line plots .\n\n\n\nPie chart\n\nggplot(mpg,aes(x=\" \"))+geom_bar(width=1,aes(fill=drv))+coord_polar(\"y\",start=0)\n\nPiechart got its name as it looks like a pie or round shape. It plots counts of a variable in a circle and it plots to take the whole circle as 100%. A pie chart is not good for multiple variable visualization.\n\n\n\nHistogram\n\n#default value for bins =30\nggplot(mpg,aes(displ))+geom_histogram(color=\"orange\")\n\nHistogram is a rectangular¬†plot which gives us the frequency of the variable¬†by making different ranges. It shows the distribution of a continuous¬†variable. Histogram is different from the bar chart, bar chart¬†relates to Two variables but histogram relates to One variable. Histogram uses the bin that divides the entire range of values into a series of intervals‚Äîand then count how many values fall into each interval.Histogram¬†also shows the distribution of the data.\n\n\n\nArea plot\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(x=cty, fill=drv)) + geom_area(stat =\"bin\", alpha=0.7,show.legend = FALSE)+ facet_grid(~drv)\n\nThe only difference between Area and line plot is the area plot is filled with color. Combination of two or more area plot form Stacked area plot.\nggplot(mpg, aes(x=cty, fill=drv)) + geom_area(stat =\"bin\", alpha=0.7)\n\n¬†\n\nBoxplot\n\n¬†\nggplot(mpg,aes(cyl,cty,fill=cyl))+geom_boxplot()\n\nBoxplot plots five number summary in single plot ie¬†minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. The¬†box upper and lower side shows third and the first quartile respectively. Middle line in the box shows the median value.¬† The line above and below the box shows maximum and minimum value and points outside this line¬†are called outliers\n\n\n\nDensity Plot\n\nggplot(mpg,aes(hwy))+geom_density(fill=\"blue\",alpha=0.3)\n\nDensity plot shows the distribution of the data. This plot shows the smooth distribution¬†by smoothing out the noise.¬†The peaks of Density Plot display where values are concentrated over the interval.\nThese are the few of the many visualization types which are used in Data Analysis or Data Science. I hope it this was helpful for and if you have any query or want to give feedback please use the comment section.\nCode for the visualization in this¬†Github repo ."

It is difficult to meet each other in-person and the events like the conference are the one which helps Campus Experts get together, talk and share their experiences.\nIt all started a day before GitHub Satellite, we had Campus Experts Meetup. All campus experts attending delivered lightning talks shared their experiences, had good foods and drink.\n\nGood sketch notes by Carlos Gilmar (@carlos) to summarise Campus Experts meetup.\n\nThe next day, around 8:30 AM, I went to the Kraftwerk, GitHub Satellite venue. I grabbed the batches, had some breakfast and went to reserve the seats for the keynote.\nAt 9:30 AM, Nat Friedman, GitHub CEO started his keynote.\n Nat told the 36 million developer calls ‚ÄúGitHub Home‚Äù. He featured the first black hole image, introduced Dr.¬†Katie Bouman all the way from Boston. To our surprise, the core team behind black hole image, Andrew, Kazu, Sarah, C.K, Roman and Lindy joined the keynote on the stage.\n\nThere was an announcement about collaboration with White Source and Depandabot.\n\nThen, Devon Zuegel announced support for open source contributor called, GitHub Sponsors. To sum up the keynote, Nat announced GitHub matching fund i.e 200% fund transfer on sponsorship.\n\nAt the session, In the Shadows of Black Hole, I got to know more about Black Hole.\n During the conference break, I got to meet with Nat Friedman, CEO of GitHub, Lieke Boon, Developer Program Manager at GitHub.\n\n\nIt was great experience so far. I‚Äôm very thankful to GitHub for providing such an opportunity to attend this conference."

I also set an arbitrary ‚Äúrandom state‚Äù ¬†so that program can reproduce our results.\n\nVisualization\n\nNow I will plot graph to understand the features and the species in data.I am using seaborne and matplotlib to make these graph plots :\nsns.set(style=\"ticks\")\niris = sns.load_dataset(\"iris\")\nsns.pairplot(iris, hue=\"species\",palette=\"bright\")\nplt.show()\n\nThe above graph is scatterplot which is plotted between four features of iris in 12 different plots. In the above picture, we can see the samples formed clusters according to their species.\nIn next graph, i will plot the 4 features of 3 iris species in barplot:\npiris = pd.melt(iris, \"species\", var_name=\"measurement\") sns.factorplot(x=\"measurement\", y=\"value\", hue=\"species\", data=piris, size=7, kind=\"bar\",palette=\"bright\") plt.show() \nprint(piris.head())\n\n#  species   measurement  value\n#0  setosa  sepal_length    5.1\n#1  setosa  sepal_length    4.9\n#2  setosa  sepal_length    4.7\n#3  setosa  sepal_length    4.6\n#4  setosa  sepal_length    5.0\n\nIn above code, I made new variable piris to make the visualization easier. This picture shows how three species of iris differ on basis of the four features.\n\nDecision tree\n\nDecision tree algorithm is simple supervised learning algorithm which is used in regression and classification problems. I will make ¬†Decision Tree classifier and fit training data (X_train and y_train) to train the model.\nclf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier()\nclf.fit(X_train,y_train)\n\n#DecisionTreeClassifier(class_weight=None, criterion='gini', max_depth=None,\n#            max_features=None, max_leaf_nodes=None,\n#            min_impurity_split=1e-07, min_samples_leaf=1,\n#            min_samples_split=2, min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0,\n#            presort=False, random_state=None, splitter='best')\n¬†\nAfter fitting the training data the Decision_tree classifier makes a tree using which classifier will classify the species of test data. The Decision Tree can be created as below:\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\niris=load_iris()\ntree.export_graphviz(clf,\nout_file='iris.dot',  feature_names=iris.feature_names,  \n                         class_names=iris.target_names,  \n                         filled=True, rounded=True,  \n                         special_characters=True)\nI am using the graphviz and dot module to create a dot file which can be visualized using graphviz application. The tree I got is below: \nUsing above tree the classifier will classify our test data. Remember the above tree is formed by the classifier using the training data.\n\nPrediction\n\nIt is time for the prediction about species of the testing data and it is the test of our model.\ny_pred = (clf.predict(X_test))\nI passed the X_test data to model get the prediction from our model and saved prediction as y_pred.\n\nAccuracy check\n\nprint ('Accuracy Score');\nprint (accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)* 100);\n\n#Accuracy Score\n#95.5555555556\nMy model got accuracy Score of 95.5556 out of 100.\n\nSave the model\n\nIt is time to save the model for future use and complete the task.\njoblib.dump(clf, 'iris.pkl')\n#['iris.pkl']\n\n\nI can load this .pkl file as below:\nclf2 = joblib.load('iris.pkl')\nclf2.predict(X_test)\nAfter loading the model I can use to predict the data as in above section."

Other groups presented with lesion giving drama.\n\nJokes, Stories and Fun\nDuring the session, we listened up and downs of international personalities (Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Satya Nadella), and different technology leads (Microsoft, Google, Oracle).\nAllen sir also shared his past memories about, how he got chance to visit Bill Gates home and knew the truth of Bill Gates life. As a part of the humor, Allen sir also cracked joke of, Bill Gates in a Restaurant.\n\nOnce, Bill Gates went to a restaurant. After having food, he only tipped $100 to the waiter.\nWaiter: Your daughter always give me $1K as a tip. But you the world richest person, only gave $100 ?\nBill Gates: She is the daughter of the world‚Äôs richest person but I‚Äôm the son of a lawyer.\n\nDuring this session, we got a chance to learn how young startups emerged out to revolutionize the world with no big investments."

We can convert any objects to character values using as.character().\n{} chadata <- ‚ÄòComputer is a device.‚Äô # create object with string chadata # print the object\nclass(chadata) # class of object\n\n\nNumeric\nObjects with decimal value have numeric class. It is the default computational data type.\n{} numdata <- 23.5 #create object numdata #print object\nclass(numdata) # class of object\n\n\nInteger\nInteger in R is the whole number. To create Integer, we use L after the value or invoke as.integer function.\n{} intdata <- as.integer(10) intdatum <- 20L # create objects\nintdata # print intdatum # print object\nclass(intdata) class(intdatum) # class of object\n\n\nComplex\nA complex value is pure imaginary value i.\n{} imgdata <- 4i # create object\nimgdata # print object\nclass(imgdata) # class of object\n\n\nLogical\nObjects with TRUE or FALSE value is a logical class object.\n{} x <- 1 y <- 0 logidata <- x + y # create object\nlogidata #print object class(logidata) # class of object\nKey Points\n\nR‚Äôs basic class of object are character, numeric, integer, complex, and logical.\nObjects may have attributes like name, dimension, class, length."
