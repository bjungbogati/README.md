<p>We had the Principals from 4 different MICNIC college (ISMT Collge, Prime College, Kathmandu Bernhardt College) . As representative of college, MSPs got different challenges to face. Also, we discuss alot in how to eradicate the gap between the Industry and Academy.</p>
<p>Problems that MSPs are facing in their respetive colleges - Approval to conduct Tech Events within College - No or Inactive IT Community - No academic calendar listing Tech events - Lack of support/motivation from College Administration</p>
<p>Possible Solutions : - Request your college management (Highlight the both students and college benefits) - Build strong network within college (Form IT Club, IT community of college in facebook) - Cooperate with the IT Community - Tie-up with the Class representative of your college - Maintain good relation with College administration</p>

<p>After all, the two day MSP Springboard event was just the beggining of our journey with motto <strong>Transforming from Catterpillar to Butterfly</strong>. The Speaker and Panelist did their great job, motivating MSPs through out the session. We also took the best opportunities to have our question answered.</p>
<p>Finally, in short description the MSP 2017 Springboard was feature package of Awesomeness, Motivation, filled with Inspiration, Knowledge Sharing, Great Experience, also aspiring MSPs to be the Tech leaders.</p>
